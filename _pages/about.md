I am currently an ATER (Attaché Temporaire d’Enseignement et de Recherche) at the Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse.

I obtained my PhD in Mathematics at the Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse under the supervision of Prof. [Franck Boyer](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~fboyer/) and Prof. Michel Fournié. Previously, I completed my Master’s degree in Mathematics under the supervision of Prof. Alberto Mercado at the Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María in Chile.

My research interests lie primarily in the analysis of partial differential equations. I am particularly interested in the study of fluid–structure interaction problems, with a focus on questions related to well-posedness, stabilization, and numerical aspects.
